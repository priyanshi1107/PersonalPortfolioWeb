            <p>
                Hello, I am Priyanshi Soni,<br>
                and I am thrilled to welcome you to my personal portfolio website.<br>
                As a passionate Java developer and a dedicated MCA student, I am constantly exploring<br>
                the world of programming and learning new languages and technologies. 
                I am a fast learner<br> and always eager to take on new challenges. I believe that learning is a never-ending journey,<br>
                and I am committed to staying updated with the latest trends in the tech world.<br>
                <br>
                I have a keen interest in video editing using VN and Adobe Premiere Pro,<br>
                enabling me to express my creativity through compelling visual storytelling.<br>
                Beyond coding and academics, I am a confident public speaker with an active <br> involvement in debate competitions,
                honing my communication skills <br> and mastering the art of presenting ideas effectively.<br>
                <br>

                I completed my schooling from SSVM School, Agar Malwa, with impressive <br>academic achievements.
                In my Class 10th, I secured 86%, and in Class 12th, <br>I obtained 84%.
                I pursued my BSc in Computer Science, where I obtained 
                <br>a commendable 71% and further nurtured my love for programming.<br>
                <br>
